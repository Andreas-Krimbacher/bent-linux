Subject: [THTTPD] CGI of minor interest

 I get quite a few worms and other hack attempts on my minor
little personal website. Of course, they don't do any harm,
really, since I'm running thttpd, and they are aimed at IIS,
or, rarely, Apache.

 But I've wanted to do more than just log them. Reporting them
generally doesn't do any good, so I hit upon the idea of
redirecting them somewhere. I considered redirecting them to a
third party (microsoft.com and fbi.gov being good examples) but
that's ethically dubious. So instead, I resolved to redirect
them back to the originating machine.

 I can't see any real ethical problems with that (after all,
they are either an infected zombie, in which case reinfection
is hardly a problem, or a malicious attacker, in which case I
can't feel much sympathy), or legal ones for that matter. If
any attacking is done, it's the originator doing the attacking
anyway.

 In practice, I doubt this'll do much. I would imagine most
worms and spiders wouldn't make any distinction between '404'
and '302' for most purposes. They probably just check to see
if it returns '200' or 'other'. But it makes me feel better.

 The 'redirect' CGI that comes with thttpd is inconvenient for
this purpose; having to symlink *and* edit the .redirects file
is a bit awkward, plus you can't redirect to the originating
IP; at best you can redirect to 127.0.0.1 (though actually,
anything in the 127.x.x.x subnet'll work; try pinging 127.5.5.5
sometime).

 The attached CGI uses the REMOTE_ADDR CGI variable to redirect
the request back to the originating machine. Remember to compile
statically if you're using a chroot jail, e.g.:

 gcc bakatca.c -o bakatcha -static

 For example, I have "/cgi-bin", "/_vti_bin", "/formmail.pl",
and so forth symlinked to this script. Like I said, I don't
know if it does any real good, but it makes me feel better and
it's simple to do.

 Sincerely,
