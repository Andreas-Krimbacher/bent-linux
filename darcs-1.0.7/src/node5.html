Configuring darcs
</H1>

<P>
There are several ways you can adjust darcs' behavior to suit your needs.
The first is to edit files in the <code>_darcs/prefs/</code> directory of a
repository.  Such configuration only applies when working with that
repository.  To configure darcs on a per-user rather than per-repository
basis (but with essentially the same methods), you can edit (or create)
files in the <code>~/.darcs/</code> directory.  Finally, the behavior of some
darcs commands can be modified by setting appropriate environment
variables.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00510000000000000000">
prefs</A>
</H1>

<P>
The <code>_darcs</code> directory contains a <code>prefs</code>  directory.  This
directory exists simply to hold user configuration settings specific to
this repository.  The contents of this directory are intended to be
modifiable by the user, although in some cases a mistake in such a
modification may cause darcs to behave strangely.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00510010000000000000"></A><A NAME="defaults"></A>
<BR>
defaults
</H4>

<P>
Default values for darcs commands can be configured on a per-repository
basis by editing (and possibly creating) the <code>_darcs/prefs/defaults</code>
file.  Each line of this file has the following form:
<PRE>
COMMAND FLAG VALUE
</PRE>
where <code>COMMAND</code> is either the name of the command to which the default
applies, or <code>ALL</code> to indicate that the default applies to all commands
accepting that flag.  The <code>FLAG</code> term is the name of the long argument
option without the ``<code>--</code>'', i.e. <code>verbose</code> rather than
<code>--verbose</code>.  Finally, the <code>VALUE</code> option can be omitted if the
flag is one such as <code>verbose</code> that doesn't involve a value.
Each line only takes one flag.  To set multiple defaults for the same
command (or for <code>ALL</code> commands), use multiple lines.

<P>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT"><TT><code>~/.darcs/defaults</code></TT></TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">provides defaults for this user account</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT"><TT><code>repo/_darcs/prefs/defaults</code></TT></TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">provides defaults for one project,</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">overrules changes per user</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
For example, if your system clock is bizarre, you could instruct darcs to
always ignore the file modification times by adding the following line to
your <code>_darcs/prefs/defaults</code> file.  (Note that this would have to be
done for each repository!)
<PRE>
ALL ignore-times
</PRE>

<P>
If you never want to run a test when recording to a particular repository
(but still want to do so when running
<code>check</code> on that repository), and like to name
all your patches ``Stupid patch'', you could use the following:
<PRE>
record no-test
record patch-name Stupid patch
</PRE>

<P>
If you would like a command to be run every time patches are recorded
in a particular repository (for example if you have one central
repository, that all developers contribute to), then you can set apply
to always run a command when apply is successful.  For example, if you
need to make sure that the files in the repository have the correct
access rights you might use the following.  There are two things
to note about using darcs this way:

<UL>
<LI>Without the second line you will get errors, because the sub
      process that runs apply cannot prompt interactively.
</LI>
<LI>Whatever script is run by the post apply command should not be
      be added to the repository with <code>darcs add</code>; doing so would
      allow people to modify that file and then run arbitrary scripts on
      your main repository, possibly damaging or violating security.
</LI>
</UL>
<PRE>
apply posthook chmod -R a+r *
apply run-posthook
</PRE> 

<P>
There are some options which are meant specifically for use in
<code>_darcs/prefs/defaults</code>. One of them is <code>--disable</code>. As the name
suggests, this option will disable every command that got it as argument. So,
if you are afraid that you could damage your repositories by inadvertent use of
a command like amend-record, add the following line to
<code>_darcs/prefs/defaults</code>:
<PRE>
amend-record disable
</PRE>

<P>
Also, a global preferences file can be created with the name
<code>.darcs/defaults</code> in your home directory. Options present there will
be added to the repository-specific preferences.
If they conflict with repository-specific options, the repository-specific
ones will take precedence.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00510020000000000000">
repos</A>
</H4>
The <code>_darcs/prefs/repos</code> file contains a list of repositories you have
pulled from or pushed to, and is used for autocompletion of pull and push
commands in bash.  Feel free to delete any lines from this list that might
get in there, or to delete the file as a whole.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00510030000000000000"></A><A NAME="author_prefs"></A>
<BR>
author
</H4>
The <code>_darcs/prefs/author</code> file contains the email address (or name) to
be used as the author when patches are recorded in this repository,
e.g. <code>David Roundy &lt;droundy@abridgegame.org&gt;</code>.  This
file overrides the contents of the environment variables
<code>$DARCS_EMAIL</code> and <code>$EMAIL</code>.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00510040000000000000"></A><A NAME="boring"></A>
<BR>
boring
</H4>
The <code>_darcs/prefs/boring</code> file may contain a list of regular
expressions describing files, such as object files, that you do not expect
to add to your project.  As an example, the boring file that I use with
my darcs repository is:
<PRE>
\.hi$
\.o$
^\.[^/]
^_
~$
(^|/)CVS($|/)
</PRE>
A newly created repository has a longer boring file that
includes many common source control, backup, temporary, and compiled files.

<P>
You may want to have the boring file under version
control.  To do this you can use darcs setpref to set the value
``boringfile'' to the name of your desired boring file
(e.g. <code>darcs setpref boringfile .boring</code>, where <code>.boring</code>
is the repository path of a file
that has been
darcs added to your repository).  The boringfile preference overrides
<code>_darcs/prefs/boring</code>, so be sure to copy that file to the boringfile.

<P>
You can also set up a ``boring'' regexps
file in your home directory, named <code>~/.darcs/boring</code>, which will be
used with all of your darcs repositories.

<P>
Any file whose repository path (such as <code>manual/index.html</code>) matches any of
the boring regular expressions is considered boring.  The boring file is
used to filter the files provided to darcs add, to allow you to use a
simple <code>darcs add newdir newdir/*</code>
without accidentally adding a bunch of
object files.  It is also used when the <code>--look-for-adds</code> flag is
given to whatsnew or record.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00510050000000000000">
binaries</A>
</H4>
The <code>_darcs/prefs/binaries</code> file may contain a list of regular
expressions describing files that should be treated as binary files rather
than text files.  You probably will want to have the binaries file under
version control.  To do this you can use darcs setpref to set the value
``binariesfile'' to the name of your desired binaries file
(e.g. <code>darcs setpref binariesfile ./.binaries</code>, where
<code>.binaries</code> is a file that has been
darcs added to your repository).  As with the boring file, you can also set
up a <code>~/.darcs/binaries</code> file if you like.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00510060000000000000">
email</A>
</H4>
The <code>_darcs/prefs/email</code> file is used to provide the e-mail address for your  
repository that others will use when they <code>darcs send</code> a patch back to you.
The contents of the file should simply be an e-mail address.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00510070000000000000"></A><A NAME="motd"></A>
<BR>
motd
</H4>
The <code>_darcs/prefs/motd</code> file may contain a ``message of the day''
which will be displayed to users who get or pull from the repository without the
<code>--quiet</code> option.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00520000000000000000">
Environment variables</A>
</H1>

<P>
There are a few environment variables whose contents affect darcs'
behavior.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00520010000000000000">
DARCS_EMAIL</A>
</H4>
The DARCS_EMAIL environment variable determines the ``author'' name used
by darcs when recording if no <code>_darcs/prefs/author</code> exists.  If
DARCS_EMAIL is undefined, the contents of the EMAIL environment variable
are used.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00520020000000000000">
DARCS_EDITOR</A>
</H4>
When pulling up an editor (for example, when adding a long comment in
record), darcs uses the contents of DARCS_EDITOR if it is defined.  If
not, it tries the contents of VISUAL, and if that isn't defined (or fails
for some reason), it tries EDITOR.  If none of those environment variables
are defined, darcs tries <code>vi</code>, <code>emacs</code>, <code>emacs -nw</code> and
<code>nano</code> in that order.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00520030000000000000">
DARCS_TMPDIR</A>
</H4>
If the environment variable DARCS_TMPDIR is defined, darcs will use that
directory for its temporaries.  Otherwise it will use TMPDIR, if that is
defined, and if not that then <code>/tmp</code> and if <code>/tmp</code> doesn't exist,
it'll put the temporaries in <code>_darcs</code>.

<P>
This is very helpful, for example, when recording with a test suite that
uses MPI, in which case using <code>/tmp</code> to hold the test copy is no good,
as <code>/tmp</code> isn't shared over NFS and thus the <code>mpirun</code> call will
fail, since the binary isn't present on the compute nodes.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00520040000000000000">
HOME</A>
</H4>
HOME is used to find the per-user prefs directory, which is located at
<code>$HOME/.darcs</code>.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00520050000000000000">
TERM</A>
</H4>
If darcs is compiled with libcurses support and support for color output,
it uses the environment variable TERM to decide whether or not color is
supported on the output terminal.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00520060000000000000">
SSH_PORT</A>
</H4>
When using ssh, if the SSH_PORT environment variable is defined, darcs will
use that port rather than the default ssh port (which is 22).

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00520070000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="darcsssh"></A>
<BR>
DARCS_SSH
</H4>
The DARCS_SSH environment variable defines the command that darcs will use
when asked to run ssh.  This command is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> interpreted by a shell,
so you cannot use shell metacharacters, and the first word in the command
must be the name of an executable located in your path.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00520080000000000000">
DARCS_SCP and DARCS_SFTP</A>
</H4>
The DARCS_SCP and DARCS_SFTP environment variables define the
commands that darcs will use when asked to run scp or sftp.  Darcs uses
scp and sftp to access repositories whose address is of the
form <code>user@foo.org:foo</code> or <code>foo.org:foo</code>.  Darcs will use
scp to copy single files (e.g. repository meta-information), and sftp
to copy multiple files in batches (e.g. patches).  These commands are
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> interpreted by a shell, so you cannot use shell
metacharacters, and the first word in the command must be the name of
an executable located in your path.  By default, <code>scp</code> and <code>sftp</code>
are used.  When you can use sftp, but not scp (e.g. some ISP web sites), it
works to set DARCS_SCP to `sftp'.  The other way around does not work, i.e. 
DARCS_FTP must reference an sftp program, not scp.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00520090000000000000">
DARCS_PROXYUSERPWD</A>
</H4>
This environment variable allows DARCS and libcurl to access remote repositories
via a password-protected HTTP proxy. The proxy itself is specified with the standard
environment variable for this purpose, namely 'http_proxy'. The DARCS_PROXYUSERPWD
environment variable specifies the proxy username and password. It must be given in 
the form <SPAN  CLASS="textit">username:password</SPAN>.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION005200100000000000000">
DARCS_GET_FOO, DARCS_MGET_FOO and DARCS_APPLY_FOO</A>
</H4>
When trying to access a repository with a URL beginning foo://,
darcs will invoke the program specified by the DARCS_GET_FOO
environment variable (if defined) to download each file, and the
command specified by the DARCS_APPLY_FOO environment variable (if
defined) when pushing to a foo:// URL.  

<P>
This method overrides all other ways of getting <code>foo://xxx</code> URLs.

<P>
Note that each command should be constructed so that it sends the downloaded
content to STDOUT, and the next argument to it should be the URL.  Here are some
examples that should work for DARCS_GET_HTTP:

<P>
<PRE>
fetch -q -o -  
curl -s -f
lynx -source 
wget -q -O -
</PRE>

<P>
If set, DARCS_MGET_FOO
will be used to fetch many files from a single repository simultaneously.
Replace FOO and foo as appropriate to handle other URL schemes.
These commands are <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> interpreted by a shell, so you cannot
use shell metacharacters, and the first word in the command must
be the name of an executable located in your path. The GET command
will be called with a URL for each file.  The MGET command will be
invoked with a number of URLs and is expected to download the files
to the current directory, preserving the file name but not the path.
The APPLY command will be called with a darcs patchfile piped into
its standard input. Example:

<P>
<PRE>
wget -q
</PRE>

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION005200110000000000000">
DARCS_MGETMAX</A>
</H4>
When invoking a DARCS_MGET_FOO command, darcs will limit the
number of URLs presented to the command to the value of this variable,
if set, or 200.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION005200120000000000000">
DARCS_WGET</A>
</H4>
This is a very old option that is only used if libcurl is not compiled
in and one of the DARCS_GET_FOO is not used. Using one of those
is recommended instead.

<P>
The DARCS_WGET environment variable defines the command that darcs
will use to fetch all URLs for remote repositories.  The first word in
the command must be the name of an executable located in your path.
Extra arguments can be included as well, such as:

<P>
<PRE>
wget -q
</PRE>

<P>
Darcs will append <code>-i</code> to the argument list, which it uses to provide a
list of URLS to download. This allows wget to download multiple patches at the
same time. It's possible to use another command besides <code>wget</code> with this
environment variable, but it must support the <code>-i</code> option in the same way. 

<P>
These commands are <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> interpreted by a shell, so you cannot use shell
meta-characters.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00530000000000000000">
Highlighted output</A>
</H1>

<P>
If the terminal understands ANSI color escape sequences,
darcs will highlight certain keywords and delimiters when printing patches.
This can be turned off by setting the environment variable DARCS_DONT_COLOR to 1.
If you use a pager that happens to understand ANSI colors, like <code>less -R</code>,
darcs can be forced always to highlight the output
by setting DARCS_ALWAYS_COLOR to 1.
If you can't see colors you can set DARCS_ALTERNATIVE_COLOR to 1,
and darcs will use ANSI codes for bold and reverse video instead of colors.

<P>
By default darcs will escape (by highlighting if possible) any kind of spaces at the end of lines
when showing patch contents.
If you don't want this you can turn it off by setting
DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_TRAILING_SPACES to 1.
A special case exists for only carriage returns:
DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_TRAILING_CR.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00540000000000000000">
Character escaping and non-ASCII character encodings</A>
</H1>

<P>
Darcs needs to escape certain characters when printing patch contents to a terminal.
Characters like <SPAN  CLASS="textit">backspace</SPAN> can otherwise hide patch content from the user,
and other character sequences can even in some cases redirect commands to the shell
if the terminal allows it.

<P>
By default darcs will only allow printable 7-bit ASCII characters (including space),
and the two control characters <SPAN  CLASS="textit">tab</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">newline</SPAN>.
(See the last paragraph in this section for a way to tailor this behavior.)
All other octets are printed in quoted form (as <code>^&lt;control letter&gt;</code> or <code>\<hex code&gt;</code>).

<P>
Darcs has some limited support for locales.
If the system's locale is a single-byte character encoding,
like the Latin encodings,
you can set the environment variable DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_ISPRINT to 1
and darcs will display all the printables in the current system locale
instead of just the ASCII ones.
NOTE: This curently does not work on some architectures if darcs is
compiled with GHC&nbsp;6.4. Some non-ASCII control characters might be printed
and can possibly spoof the terminal.

<P>
For multi-byte character encodings things are less smooth.
UTF-8 will work if you set DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_8BIT to 1,
but non-printables outside the 7-bit ASCII range are no longer escaped.
E.g., the extra control characters from Latin-1
might leave your terminal at the mercy of the patch contents.
Space characters outside the 7-bit ASCII range are no longer recognized
and will not be properly escaped at line endings.

<P>
As a last resort you can set DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_ANYTHING to 1.
Then everything that doesn't flip code sets should work,
and so will all the bells and whistles in your terminal.
This environment variable can also be handy
if you pipe the output to a pager or external filter
that knows better than darcs how to handle your encoding.
Note that <SPAN  CLASS="textit">all</SPAN> escaping,
including the special escaping of any line ending spaces,
will be turned off by this setting.

<P>
There are two environment variables you can set
to explicitly tell darcs to not escape or escape octets.
They are
DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_EXTRA and DARCS_ESCAPE_EXTRA.
Their values should be strings consisting of the verbatim octets in question.
The do-escapes take precedence over the dont-escapes.
Space characters are still escaped at line endings though.
The special environment variable DARCS_DONT_ESCAPE_TRAILING_CR
turns off escaping of carriage return last on the line (DOS style).
