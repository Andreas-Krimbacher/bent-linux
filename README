Bent Linux: small simple distro, statically linked against uClibc

The original work in Bent Linux --- the bpm software packaging tools
and the spec files written for them --- is copyright 2004, 2005,
2006, 2007 Bennett Todd, and is distributed under the terms of the
GNU General Public License.

News: 2006-07-04 switched from darcs to git

News: 2005-05-29 added ppc

News: 2005-05-18 1.2 -> i386

In anticipation of adding ppc, and recognition that the previous
Bent Linux revisions are so stale as to not be of interest (and so
the 1.2 version number no longer communicates anything interesting),
I've moved the 1.2 dir, containing the built bpms, to i386.

News: 2005-02-19 marks 1.2.

The major change is bpm 0.8 -> 0.9, sha1 file to sha256 for
manifest; and 1.2 no longer has separate subdirs, bpmdist is
replaced by the darcs repository.

News: 2004-10-10 marks the splitting off of version 1.1.

The major change is that uClibc is updated, and built without any
    dynamic libs at all, hence no libdl.

See HINTS for a collection of assorted notes that might make it
    easier to do something with Bent Linux

I just added a darcs dir, which I'm hoping will be a darcs
    repository I'll keep all my work in; if so, it will take over
    for the bpmdist trees; eventually I may try and import them
    under darcs.

Darcs users can "darcs get http://bent.latency.net/bent/darcs/" to
    grab a copy of the darcs repo. Without the sources that bpmbuild
    will automatically download, it's only about 5.3MB as of this
    writing.

Based on the darcs version control, I've set up an RSS feed of the
    patches -- just patch names, no descriptions, but I try to name
    them meaningfully.

Bpm packages work fine on most any Linux; I've added bpm2rpm to the
    bpm package.
